1.Why I have used React for this ?

Ans ->

There are several reasons why I have used React. React is commonly used for building web applications like the one I have implemented. Here are some of the key advantages of using React:

a) Component-Based Architecture: React allows you to build your application using reusable components. Each component encapsulates its own
logic, state, and UI, making it easier to develop and maintain complex user interfaces.

b)Virtual DOM: React uses a virtual DOM (Document Object Model) to efficiently update and render UI components. The virtual DOM is a
lightweight representation of the actual DOM, and React uses it to perform efficient diffing and minimize the number of real DOM updates,
resulting in improved performance.

c) Declarative Syntax: React uses a declarative syntax, which means you describe how your UI should look based on its current state, and
React takes care of updating the UI to match that state. This approach simplifies UI development and makes it easier to reason about the
application's behavior.

d) Efficient Updates: React's diffing algorithm allows for efficient updates to the UI. Instead of re-rendering the entire UI, React only
updates the parts that have changed, resulting in faster rendering and improved performance.

e) React Hooks: With the introduction of React Hooks, you can easily manage state and side effects in functional components. Hooks provide a
simpler way to handle stateful logic and allow you to reuse code across different components.

2. Why firebase database is used?
Ans ->

Cloud Firestore, a part of the Firebase suite, is a NoSQL document database that is used in your code. Here are some reasons why Cloud Firestore is
a suitable choice:

Scalability: Cloud Firestore is designed to scale horizontally, automatically handling large amounts of data and high traffic loads. It can
seamlessly accommodate growing user bases and increasing data volumes without compromising performance.

Real-time Updates: Similar to the Firebase Realtime Database, Cloud Firestore provides real-time updates. It uses a powerful feature called
Firestore Sync, which enables automatic synchronization of data changes between the client and server in real-time. This allows for real-time
collaboration, instant updates, and live data streaming in your application.

Flexible Data Model: Cloud Firestore offers a flexible and scalable data model based on documents and collections. You can organize your data
into collections, which contain individual documents.
